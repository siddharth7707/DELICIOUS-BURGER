				At times when we are in a hurry, hamburgers are one of the easiest foods to eat while on the go.
				No matter what time it is whether its breakfast, lunch, or dinner we grab a hamburger and might throw in some
				fries and a soda to go with it. Many restaurants are known to make their hamburgers in a specific way.
				Preparation differs from restaurant to restaurant. But what really makes a hamburger taste so delicious? 
				Depending where you go they will taste different but they are all structured the same.
				It consists of a bun, a ground meat patty and often ingredients such as cheese, onion slices, lettuce and other condiments.
				I occasionally like to buy juicy burgers that look and taste great. 
				When your food is served it does not only have to taste good, but also has to look good in order for it to be appetizing.
				Hamburgers, no doubt, look very pleasing to the eyes and are round in shape with many layers of nutrients.
